    * In this project we created a covid-19 case management and monitoring tool.
     this tool automates the payment of the different health workers as well as assigning them different roles and positions including the hospitals to work with.
    * This system uses two applications, the web application as well as the commandline application. the command line application is designed in c program in a way that the health workers can register the covid-19 case details. these details are subtmited to a database.
     *the web application is designed using laravel(8) a php framework.
     NB:the c program works best in linux environment.
       :the web application was hosted on heroku server can be accessed from any browser using this link (cmarsproject.herokuapp.com)
